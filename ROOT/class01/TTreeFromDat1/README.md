# TTreeFromDat1
Author: Fernando Quinonez
Date: 2016-06-17

In this project a ROOT File with a Tree inside is created, coming from a dat file.
The .dat file is simply the same as the .txt but without metadata.
This data correspond to the stopping powers and other parameters for
electrons going through water. The data have been downloaded from:
http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/Star/Text/ESTAR.html

## How to run
```bash
    make
    ./main
```
It generates a file called *electronWater.root*
