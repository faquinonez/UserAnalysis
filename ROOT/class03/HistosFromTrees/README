principal code that makes the histograms from trees.
The way to use this code is to do:
make 
to compile, and
./validagps tree1.root
to run.


In order to run over a big validagps of data, the idea is to do a validagps.txt with 
all the trees and add at the begining of each 
line 

./validagps tree1.root
./validagps tree2.root
./validagps tree3.root
./validagps tree4.root

Then we must to change the validagps.txt by validagps.sh, and change the permissions
by

chmod ug+x validagps.sh

after that we could run by making

nohup ./validagps.sh &

and click enter twice.
Depending of the output registered in nohup.out after have run the project,
we could rename this file as 

mv nohup.out grl<DETECTOR><YEAR>.txt
